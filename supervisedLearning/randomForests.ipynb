    "### Introduction\n",
    "As we've mentioned in the previous chapter (see [decision trees](decisionTrees.ipynb)), decision trees are often used, but not as the single, final, best method. You are far more likely to encounter the concept of decision trees in the context of **random forests**. Moreover, other techniques you *will* see being used together with DT and RF are *boosting* and *bagging*.  \n",
    "In a more general sense, these are all **ensemble methods**. Ensemble methods are methods that combine the predictions of several base estimators (say, some decision trees) in order to improve generalizability / robustness over a single estimator. We will talk about these methods in more detail in the next chapter. Random Forests themselves are a type of ensemble method, and we will talk about them in this chapter.  \n",
