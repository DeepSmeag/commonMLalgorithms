# commonMLalgorithms
# This repository is meant to be an exercise for me (to better understand these algorithms and be able to implement them freely); and a tutorial to a beginner looking to learn some starting ML algorithms, understand the philosophy behind them and maybe get a general sense of how we think about data.
## Have a look at it and see if anything is of help.
