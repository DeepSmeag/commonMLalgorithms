# commonMLalgorithms

### This repository is meant to be an exercise for me (to better understand these algorithms and be able to implement them freely); and a tutorial to a beginner looking to learn some starting ML algorithms, understand the philosophy behind them and maybe get a general sense of how we think about data and solving problems

## Have a look at it and see if anything is of help  

Remember to use the "commonMLalgs" environment (see [envTutorial](envTutorial.txt)) to run the notebooks

I would recommend leaving Neural Networks for last, as it introduces the discussion about deep learning, which is a whole topic in itself. These days, most research is about deep networks, no matter what their specific architecture is, so that topic should be a different category.
