    "In this chapter, we will go in-depth into ensemble methods: why they exists, what they have to offer and where to use them. Ensemble methods are a type of machine learning algorithm that combines multiple base models in order to produce one optimal predictive model. Ensemble methods are very popular in machine learning competitions because they often produce the best predictive models. In this chapter, we will cover the following ensemble methods:\n",
