PYTHON VERSION = 3.9.13

If you're using VS Code to read the course, make sure you have the appropriate extensions; these are what I use:

If you have conda:

    conda env create -f env.yml

If you don't have conda, install / create an environment with Python version 3.9.13 or higher (incompatibility issues may appear if the discrepancy is too high)

After that, install the few libraries needed:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
