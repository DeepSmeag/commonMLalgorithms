# Welcome to my mini-tutorial

### This whole repository is meant to be an exercise to implement some (but as many as possible) of the classic ML algorithms; my goal is to go through a lot of algorithms and carefully explain where they shine and how they work (not shying away from math where possible). I also want to implement them from scratch (if feasible / worth it time-wise).

### You can expect to find algorithms that are commonly used / you hear about them often. Starting with the simplest of them, linear regression (which is more of a statistics algorithm turned CS/ML); we'll then go on and discuss a lot more things. I'll try to recap some insights when possible.
